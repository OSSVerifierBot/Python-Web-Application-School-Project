This project was an assignment in a programming class. The language that was
used was python 3.5. This is a web application that allows the user to add/
delete/display a list of "inators" on a web page. Inators are simply pieces of data
with different attributes that can be changed. The program also uses decorators
to provide different functionality. This project also utilizes FLASK to communicate
with a server. 


The decorators were written in the file utils.py and they were implemented 
in searchinator.py.
