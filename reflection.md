Python 4: Searchinator for Taylor Hasty
-----------------------------------------------------

This assignement was definitely tough. To be honest,
almost all of it was challenging to me. Especially the
utils.py file. Decorators are tough concepts for me to
grasp. After spending many hours studying and meeting with
the instructor, I ended up actually understanding what
was happening.

The easiest part of this assinment were the functions
within searchinator.py. This was easier for me because
it looked very familiar to what I am used to seeing.

I learned a ton in this assignment. Learning just basic
GET/POST was something I think is very valuable. While this
assignment definitely caused alot of stress, I think
I learned very valuable information.
